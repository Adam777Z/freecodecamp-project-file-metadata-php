**File Metadata Microservice**

### User Stories:
1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile" (required for testing).
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

### Usage:
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
